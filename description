# MemeSearch Engine 🔍😂

A meme-tastic search engine that fetches fresh memes using API magic! Built with a bold Neubrutalism design that slaps harder than the "Distracted Boyfriend" meme.

## Features ✨
- **API-Powered Meme Discovery** - Fresh memes delivered hotter than Twitter trends
- **Neubrutalism UI** - Ugly-beautiful design that stares into your soul like the "Y U No" guy
- **Lightning Fast** - Loads faster than you can say "Wait, that's illegal"
- **Responsive AF** - Works on all devices, unlike your ex

## Tech Stack 💻
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (with extra `box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 #000`)
- API: [Your API Name] (Because why reinvent the wheel?)
- Design: Pure Neubrutalism chaos (100% organic, free-range pixels)

## Why? 🤷
Because the world needed another way to procrastinate, and regular meme sites were too... subtle.

## Preview 🎨

(If this were a meme, the caption would be "When you find the perfect meme but the API returns 404")

## Installation ⚡
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishalVab01/meme-search-engine.git
cd meme-search-engine
open index.html # And let the meme magic begin!
